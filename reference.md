## Glossary

Barcode
: A barcode in spatial transcriptomics is an identifier for a spot on a slide. It is a 
unique sequence that identifies a spot. The term barcode is generic and identifies other
entities in different technologies. For example, in single-cell transcriptomics a barcode
identifies a single cell, not a spot on a slide.

Feature
: In spatial transcriptomics a gene is a feature. The term feature is generic and refers 
to different things in different technologies.
