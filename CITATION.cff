abstract: >
  Spatially resolved transcriptomics is a cutting-edge
  molecular profiling technology that measures transcript
  expression and position within a tissue. This course will
  teach you how to analyze spatial transcriptomics data
  generated by the Visium 10X platform. By the end of this
  course, you will be able to:


  1. Describe different spatial transcriptomics technologies
  and the best uses of each.

  2. Identify important elements for good experimental
  design.

  3. Analyze spatial transcriptomics data, including quality
  control, transcript quantification, and cell-type
  assignment within regions.
