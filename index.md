Spatially resolved transcriptomics is a cutting-edge molecular profiling 
technology that measures transcript expression and position within a tissue.
This course will teach you how to analyze spatial transcriptomics data generated 
by the [Visium 10X platform][visium]. By the end of this course, you will be 
able to:

- Describe different spatial transcriptomics technologies and the best uses of 
each.
- Identify important elements for good experimental design.
- Analyze spatial transcriptomics data, including quality control, transcript 
quantification, and cell-type assignment within regions.

## Prerequisites

To succeed in this course, you need to have

1.	proficiency in the R programming language;
2.	knowledge of bulk RNA and single-cell sequence analysis.
